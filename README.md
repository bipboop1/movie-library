# movie-library
personal movie library for easy viewing of local movies in a given folder


## roadmap:
- add "open folder" button
- add original title 
- add durÃ©e
- don't show synopsis, only show when clicking "show synopsis" button
- movies counter
- mark as seen
- launch from movie directory, create movides.db inside directory, keep .db here and don't delete on startup
- trigger library refresh
// - movies dir path should be set when running command, not as an environment variable
